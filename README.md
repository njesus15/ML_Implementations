# ML_Implementations
This repository contains various machine learning implemetations I have developed through projects and classwork.

## Description:

Online_classification: implements online classification algorithm using logistic regression to classify email as spam/no spam
using the UCI spam database

Thompson_Sampling: prominent algorithm that balances the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration in multi-armed bandit 
problems. The setting is 3 arms where the third arm's reward model is known and the goal is to find the optimal arm as soon as 
possible without exploiting too early.
